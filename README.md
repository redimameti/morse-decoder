This project allows the user to enter text and receive a morse code translation, or vice versa.

## Design and Implementation

As this is quite a simple application, I designed it as I built it and based the general layout on a fusion of the highest ranking google results for â€˜morse code translatorâ€™.

Iâ€™ve used the same color palette and fonts here than I did on my calculator and portfolio, to maintain some consistency across my work (this will likely change on bigger projects that require a more bespoke design).


## Project Lifecycle

I learned a valuable lesson during this build (rather, once I had *already* done most of the work). 

The previous week I had made a calculator, which was relatively more complex  of a task and required more work to complete.

Coming into this, I was prepared for a similar level of complexity and in turn ended up making my code *5 times longer* than it needed to be (Iâ€™m not exaggerating, take a look at my first commit ðŸ˜‚). 

I had used a switch, and created a case for each valid character. I received feedback for this, reminding me that we have been learning about objects the past week. And that objects would have made this whole build much easier.

The lesson is to be more committed to being a lazy coder!

So for my next project, Iâ€™d like to spend more time thinking out my plan and making sure Iâ€™m using the tools in my toolkit to make my code clean, and not make my job harder than it has to be.
